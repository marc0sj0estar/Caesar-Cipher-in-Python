A python script to learn how to encrypt and decrypt sentences using the [Caesar cipher](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caesar_cipher).

## How it works
The [Caesar cipher](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caesar_cipher) works by shifting each letter of the alphabet by a set amount and then applying that shift to a sentence.

To change the shift of the cipher, move the slider to the right or left depending on the direction you want to shift the letters.

Here is a how the alphabet would look with a shift of 5 to the right:

Keep in mind that this code is for **educational and personal use** since this is one of the oldest and most known ciphers so it is ill advised to use it for important information.

 ## Guide
 1. Have [python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) installed.
 2. [Run the program](https://realpython.com/run-python-scripts/).
 3. Insert whatever text you want to cipher into the top window.
 4. Use the slider at the bottom to shift to the right or left.
 5. The output is shown at the bottom.

> Remember that if you want to decipher a text shifted to the right, you have to shift it to the left and vice versa.
